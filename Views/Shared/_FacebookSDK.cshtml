@*The Facebook SDK for JavaScript doesn't have any standalone files that need to be downloaded or installed, instead you simply need to include a short piece of regular JavaScript in your HTML
    that will asynchronously load the SDK into your pages. The async load means that it does not block loading other elements of your page.
    The following snippet of code will give the basic version of the SDK where the options are set to their most common defaults.*@
<script>
  window.fbAsyncInit = function() {
    FB.init({
      appId      : '289906028092383',
      xfbml      : true,
      version    : 'v2.8'
    });
    FB.AppEvents.logPageView();
  };

  (function(d, s, id){
     var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
     if (d.getElementById(id)) {return;}
     js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;
     js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js";
     fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
   }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));
